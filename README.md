Analysis of the TC1 IR spectra
Calculations of amplitude, FWHM, area by using Gaussian fits
Used two methods

tc1_features1: first detecting the location of the peaks, then centered Gaussians at each peak to fit the spectra
tc1_features2: fit arbitrary Gaussians over shorter rangers, center of Gaussian is calculated by the fit
